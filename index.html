<!--With form submissions, it is useful, and good practice, 
to provide each submittable element with a "name" attribute. (any name)
This attribute is used to identify the element in the form submission.
Give each submittable element a unique name attribute of your choosing, 
except for the two radio inputs.-->
    <body>
        <h1>Registration Form</h1>
        <p>Please fill out this form with the required information</p>
<!-- insert a form with an action attribute targeting 
https://register-demo.freecodecamp.org. -->
        <form action="https://register-demo.freecodecamp.org">
<!--The three fieldset elements should be within the form-->
        <fieldset>   
<!-- <input> is a box -->
<!--Specifying the type attribute of a form element is important for the 
browser to know what kind of data it should expect. If the type is not 
specified, the browser will default to text-->
<!-- The first input element with a type of submit is automatically set 
to submit its nearest parent form element.-->
<!--To make the form more interactive, add the required attribute to ALL 
the input elements in the first fieldset-->
            <label>Enter Your First Name: <input type="text" name="first-name" required /></label>
            <label>Enter Your Last Name: <input type="text" name="last-name" required /></label>
<!--Certain type attribute values come with built-in form validation. 
For example, type="email" requires that the value be a valid email address.-->
            <label>Enter Your Email: <input type="email" name="email" required /></label>
<!--Add custom validation to the password input element, b
by adding a minlength attribute with a value of 8.
Doing so prevents inputs of less than 8 characters being submitted.-->
<!--With type="password" you can use the pattern attribute to define a regular 
expression that the password must match to be considered valid.
Add a "pattern" attribute to the password input element to require the 
input match: [a-z0-5]{8,}
The above is a regular expression which matches eight or more lowercase letters 
or the digits 0 to 5. Then, remove the ""minlength" attribute, and try it out.
-->
            <label>Create a New Password: <input type="password" name="password" pattern="[a-z0-5]{8,}" required /></label> <!-- minlength="8" removed-->
        </fieldset>
        <fieldset>
<!--You only want one radio input to be selectable at a time. However, 
the form does not know the radio inputs are related.
To relate the radio inputs, give them the **same name** attribute with a 
value of account-type. Now, it is not possible to select both radio i
nputs at the same time.-->
            <label><input type="radio" name="account-type" /> Personal Account</label>
            <label><input type="radio" name="account-type" /> Business Account</label>
            <label><input type="checkbox" name="terms" required /> I accept the <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/terms-of-service/">terms and conditions</a></label>
        </fieldset>
        <fieldset>
            <label>Upload a profile picture: <input type="file" name="file" /></label>
            <label>Input your age (years): <input type="number" name="age" min="13" max="120" /></label>
<!-- Adding a dropdown to the form is easy with the select element. The select element is a 
container for a group of option elements, and the option element acts as a label for each 
dropdown option. Both elements require closing tags-->
            <label>How did you hear about us?
                <select name="referrer" id="">
<!--Submitting the form with an option selected would not send a useful value to the server.
    As such, each option needs to be given a value attribute. Without which, the text content 
    of the option will be submitted to the server-->
                    <option value="">(select one)</option>
                    <option value="1">freeCodeCamp News</option>

                </select>
            </label>
<!--The textarea element acts like an input element of type text, but comes with the added 
    benefit of being able to receive multi-line text, and an initial number of text rows and 
    columns.-->
<!--To give Campers an idea of what to put in their bio, the placeholder attribute is used. 
    The placeholder accepts a text value, which is displayed until the user starts typing.-->
            <label>Provide a bio: <textarea name="bio" rows="3" cols="30" placeholder="I like coding on the beach..."></textarea></label>
